# Second Project

 * In this project, I have implemented an **`Air Pollution Forcasting`** task utilizing **`GRU`**, **`LSTM`**, and **`RNN`** utilizing **`Keras`**.

* The project focused mainly on the following topics:

    -   Developing a **Recurrent Nueral Net** model for a **`regression`** task: daily, weekly, and monthly **Ari Pollution Forcasting**. 

    -   Investigaton the effect of various **Recurrent Neural Net** models: GRU, LSTM, and RNN on the final performance.

    - **`Feature Selection`** based on the correlation of features with **Ari Pollution**.

    - **`Model Enseble`** prediction utilzing different recurrent structures: GRU, LSTM, and RNN.

    - **`Missing Data Imputation`** and its effects on the final performance.

* Notble Notes: 
    -   On the ground [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2), we know that **LSTM** is nearly optimal, which is compatible with my simulations' results.
    -   I applied a linear layer on the GRU, RNN, and LSTM based models in orde fuse the models in **Model Ensemble** part.

* The codes are provided in [Multi-Object Classification.py](https://github.com/ARokni/Neural-Network-/blob/main/Project%201/Multi-Object%20Classification.py) folder, and the data available in folder.
